Hackbright_Project
==================
SpaceJamz is a 3D space visualization of a user's Rdio music library, inspired by a Bloom project. SpaceJamz visualizes a user's Rdio account in a unique way: each album is represented by a new solar system, where the planets are the songs. Users can play songs, albums, or playlists while the graphics change to the music. Made with: Python, SQLAlchemy, Flask, JavaScript, THREE.js, HTML5 Canvas, WebGL, Rdio API
